I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate at Department of Architecture (DoA), National University of Singapore (NUS), supversied by Assoc. Prof. [Rudi Stouffs](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/arch/staffs/rudi-stouffs-dr/) and a Postdoctoral Research Fellow supversied by Assist. Prof. [Yu Qian Ang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Dzq-uGYAAAAJ&hl=en) at [City Syntax Lab](https://www.citysyntax.io/aboutus). I also joined the [Circular Future Cities](https://futurecitieslab.world/module/CFC) project of Future Cities Laboratory Global, [Singapore ETH Center (SEC)](https://sec.ethz.ch/), as a Ph.D. researcher from 2022-2024. Before that, I obtained my Master's degree from Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen) University in 2021.

My research interests include Building/City Information Modeling, Urban Circularity, Knowleadge Graph & Domain Modeling, and Building Material Stock Analysis.

I am looking for motivated interns (visiting Ph.D., masterâ€™s, and undergraduate students) to work on sustainable building and urban development, focusing on integrating information modeling, knowledge graph approaches (model-based), and data-driven modeling for assessing whole life cycle (embodied and operational) carbon in the built environment. If interested, feel free to email me at [peiwanyu1@gmail.com](peiwanyu1@gmail.com).
